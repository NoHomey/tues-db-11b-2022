# We work with the DB shown on **books-schema.pdf**

The end goal query that we want to come up with is for answering the following question

> Which are the users that have at least 3 orders with price that is at least 30% more than the avarage price of their orders?

Let's start with finding the total price for every order.
To do this we can enrich every *OrderItem* with the *price* of the *Book* that is pointed by the *book* field.
Then we can do a **GROUP BY** *order* and **SUM** all the *price*s.

```SQL
SELECT
  OrderItem.`order` AS `order`,
  SUM(Book.price) AS price
FROM
  OrderItem JOIN Book on OrderItem.book = Book.id
GROUP BY
  OrderItem.`order`
```

Now we can very easily enrich the *Order* with its *price* by using a SQL **WITH** clause to give a name
of the above query and to use it in a subsequent query.

```SQL
WITH
  OrderPrice AS (
  SELECT
    OrderItem.`order` AS `order`,
    SUM(Book.price) AS price
  FROM
    OrderItem JOIN Book on OrderItem.book = Book.id
  GROUP BY
    OrderItem.`order`
  )
SELECT
  `Order`.id AS `order`,
  `Order`.user AS user,
  OrderPrice.price AS price
FROM
  `Order` JOIN OrderPrice on `Order`.id = OrderPrice.`order`
```

Of course the result of the above query can be achived by doing JOIN with inlined sub-query like

```SQL
SELECT
  `Order`.id as `order`,
  `Order`.user as user,
  OrderPrice.price as price
FROM
  `Order` JOIN (
    SELECT
      OrderItem.`order` AS `order`,
      SUM(Book.price) AS price
    FROM
      OrderItem JOIN Book on OrderItem.book = Book.id
    GROUP BY
      OrderItem.`order`
  ) AS OrderPrice on `Order`.id = OrderPrice.`order`
```
And for a simple query like that probably the SQL engine will do exactly that but for more complicated quries the
engine might take advantige on its Query optimiser to do optimisations that are hard to do with hands or will
make the query extreamly hard for reading. This is why we have the SQL **WITH** clause.

Now we can build upon the result of one of the above queris to find the avarage price of an order for every user.
To do that we will use **WITH** clause with more than one Common Table Expressions (named sub-query results) or CTEs for short.

```SQL
WITH
  OrderAndPrice AS (
  SELECT
    OrderItem.`order` AS `order`,
    SUM(Book.price) AS price
  FROM
    OrderItem JOIN Book on OrderItem.book = Book.id
  GROUP BY
    OrderItem.`order`
  ),
  OrderWithPrice AS (  
  SELECT
    `Order`.id AS `order`,
    `Order`.user AS user,
    OrderAndPrice.price AS price
  FROM
    `Order` JOIN OrderAndPrice on `Order`.id = OrderAndPrice.`order`
  )
SELECT
  user,
  AVG(price) AS price
FROM
  OrderWithPrice
GROUP BY
  user
```

We are almost ready with the final query.

We can start with filtering over the enriched *Order* with *price*
for all the orders that have price at least 30% of the avarage for the user and then
to do a **GROUP BY** and to use **HAVING** to eliminate all the buckets for users
that have less than 3 such orders.

```SQL
WITH
  OrderAndPrice AS (
  SELECT
    OrderItem.`order` AS `order`,
    SUM(Book.price) AS price
  FROM
    OrderItem JOIN Book on OrderItem.book = Book.id
  GROUP BY
    OrderItem.`order`
  ),
  OrderWithPrice AS (  
  SELECT
    `Order`.id AS `order`,
    `Order`.user AS user,
    OrderAndPrice.price AS price
  FROM
    `Order` JOIN OrderAndPrice on `Order`.id = OrderAndPrice.`order`
  ),
  AvgPriceForUser AS (
  SELECT
    user,
    AVG(price) AS price
  FROM
    OrderWithPrice
  GROUP BY
    user
  )
SELECT
  user
FROM
  OrderWithPrice
WHERE price >= 1.3 * (
  SELECT
    price
  FROM 
    AvgPriceForUser
  WHERE
    OrderWithPrice.user = AvgPriceForUser.user
  )
GROUP BY
  user
HAVING
  COUNT(*) >= 3
```

For the final query all we have to do is to select the names and emails for the users that are found by the last query as sub-query CTE.

```SQL
WITH
  OrderAndPrice AS (
  SELECT
    OrderItem.`order` AS `order`,
    SUM(Book.price) AS price
  FROM
    OrderItem JOIN Book on OrderItem.book = Book.id
  GROUP BY
    OrderItem.`order`
  ),
  OrderWithPrice AS (  
  SELECT
    `Order`.id AS `order`,
    `Order`.user AS user,
    OrderAndPrice.price AS price
  FROM
    `Order` JOIN OrderAndPrice on `Order`.id = OrderAndPrice.`order`
  ),
  AvgPriceForUser AS (
  SELECT
    user,
    AVG(price) AS price
  FROM
    OrderWithPrice
  GROUP BY
    user
  ),
  MatchingUser AS (
  SELECT
    user
  FROM
    OrderWithPrice
  WHERE price >= 1.3 * (
    SELECT
      price
    FROM 
      AvgPriceForUser
    WHERE
      OrderWithPrice.user = AvgPriceForUser.user
    )
  GROUP BY
    user
  HAVING
    COUNT(*) >= 3
  )
SELECT
  User.name as name,
  User.email as email
FROM
  MatchingUser JOIN User ON MatchingUser.user = User.id
```

Of course this is not the only query that will answer the question that we try to answer.

You can experiment with 4.sql that answers very similar question in more minimalistic DB and open Pull Requests with your query.
