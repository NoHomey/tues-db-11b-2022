We are back at working with DB shown on books-schema.pdf.
We last worked with it in 4.md.

Now we want to find all the Users who have made an Order that costs at least 1000.
To do that we can use the **EXISTS** SQL operator to check wheter a sub-query has non-empty result set.

```SQL
WITH
  OrderAndPrice AS (
  SELECT
    OrderItem.`order` AS `order`,
    SUM(Book.price) AS price
  FROM
    OrderItem JOIN Book on OrderItem.book = Book.id
  GROUP BY
    OrderItem.`order`
  ),
  OrderWithPrice AS (  
  SELECT
    `Order`.id AS `order`,
    `Order`.user AS user,
    OrderAndPrice.price AS price
  FROM
    `Order` JOIN OrderAndPrice on `Order`.id = OrderAndPrice.`order`
  )
SELECT
  email
FROM
  User
WHERE EXISTS (
  (
    SELECT
      *
    FROM
      OrderWithPrice
    WHERE
      OrderWithPrice.user = id
      AND
      OrderWithPrice.price > 1000
  )
)
```
