We work with the Taxi schema (files: taxi-2.pdf, taxi.sql)

This schema is meant to represent current state of the data for the Taxi company with Tables: Taxi, Driver, Rating.

And both present and historic data for Taxi courses. When a new course is created it *endTime* will be **NULL** and *dist* will be **0.0**.

We can easially find the price of all finished courses with the following SQL query:

```SQL
SELECT
  driverID
  (TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, endTime, startTime) * timeRate + dist * distRate) AS price
WHERE
  endTime IS NOT NULL
```

Now we can easily sort drivers by the money that they've made by using the result of the above query as CTE

```SQL
WITH
  CoursePrice AS (
    SELECT
      driverID
      (TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, endTime, startTime) * timeRate + dist * distRate) AS price
    WHERE
      endTime IS NOT NULL
  )
SELECT
  Driver.name AS driverName,
  SUM(price) AS earned
FROM
  Driver LEFT JOIN CoursePrice ON CoursePrice.driverID = driver.id
GROUP BY
  Driver.id
ORDER BY
  earned DESC, driverName ASC
```
