In this lesson we wanted to find all the Comments that are Thread-starters (they are not reply to any other comment).
In order to do that all we have to do is JOIN all tables like this:

```SQL
SELECT
  User.email,
  Question.title,
  Question.content,
  Answer.content,
  Comment.content
FROM
  Comment JOIN Answer ON Comment.answer = Answer.id
          JOIN Question ON Answer.question = Question.id
          JOIN User ON Comment.user = User.id
          LEFT JOIN ReplyTo On ReplyTo.comment = Comment.id
WHERE
  ReplyTo.replyTo IS NULL
```
